## Dataset Construction

We generate sed-style puzzles by reverse-constructing solutions to guarantee solvability.
Instead of randomly sampling transitions, we first construct a valid sequence of deletions from an empty string and then hide the solution.

### Difficulty Levels
- Easy: 2–3 transitions, non-overlapping substrings
- Medium: 4–7 transitions
- Hard: >7 transitions, longer dependency chains
- (Since Hard puzzles generated by the code, is not Actually "Hard" -> I have created manually curated few (10) hard puzzles which are overlapping and adversial, requires 7-10 or more minutes for humans to solve)

### Design Rationale
- Ensuring solvability avoids penalizing models for invalid data.
- Limiting dataset size to 100(+10=110) prioritizes quality and analysis depth.
- Transitions are shuffled to prevent trivial greedy solutions.


### Distractor Transitions
In addition to solution-preserving deletion rules, we introduce distractor transitions that partially rewrite substrings instead of deleting them.
These transitions are valid but can lead to loops or dead ends if applied greedily.

This design forces models to reason about transition ordering rather than locally optimal actions.
